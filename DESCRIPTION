Description: This package quantifies the confidence in identifying all of the 
    fathers (genetically contributing males) for populations with multiple 
    paternity where it's logistically unfeasible to sample all of the offspring. 
    The package is built such that hatchlings_to_sample() must be run to provide 
    output that is used as input for clutches_to_sample(). Similarly, 
    probability_id_fathers() must be run to produce output that is used as input 
    for conditional_probabilities().
